I am S. A. Nair.

I also go around as Cessposter and nVista2007.

I like doing pointless nonsense.

I prefer to program in C.

Linux sux.
BSD FOREVER, FOCK THE WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORLD

Oh, I found it at Cashies, mate
Where you can find your dreams
They've got wares and chairs and a bog dowstairs
Some clubs, some tubs, and hats for scrubs
And out of date movies

So get on down to Cashies, mate
You know it'll change your life
So get off the floor, head out the door
Forget eBay, they'll charge you more
And lose your life at Cashies, Mate!
